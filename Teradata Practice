Exercise 2. Use a CASE statement within an aggregate function to determine which sku
had the greatest total sales during the combined summer months of June, July, and August.

SELECT TOP 1
sku,
SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM saledate)=6 THEN amt END) AS june_sales, 
SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM saledate)=7 THEN amt END) AS july_sales,
SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM saledate)=8 THEN amt END) AS august_sales,
june_sales+july_sales+august_sales as total_sales
FROM trnsact
GROUP BY sku
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
