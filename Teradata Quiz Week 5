1. How many distinct skus have the brand “Polo fas”, and are either size “XXL” or “black” in color?

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(sku))
FROM skuinfo
WHERE brand='Polo fas' AND (size='XXL' OR color='black');

RIGHT
OUTPUT: 13623

2. There was one store in the database which had only 11 days in one of its months 
(in other words, that store/month/year combination only contained 11 days of transaction data). 
In what city and state was this store located?

SELECT city, state
FROM strinfo
WHERE store=(
SELECT store
FROM trnsact
GROUP BY store, EXTRACT(month from saledate), EXTRACT(year from saledate)
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT(EXTRACT(day from saledate)))=11);

RIGHT
OUTPUT: ATLANTA GA

3. Which sku number had the greatest increase in total sales revenue from November to December?

SELECT TOP 1
sku,
SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM saledate)=11 THEN amt END) AS november_sales, 
SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM saledate)=12 THEN amt END) AS december_sales,
december_sales-november_sales as increase_in_sales
FROM trnsact
GROUP BY sku
ORDER BY increase_in_sales DESC;

RIGHT
OUTPUT:3949538

4. What vendor has the greatest number of distinct skus in the transaction table that do not exist in the skstinfo table?

SELECT TOP 1 COUNT(DISTINCT(s.sku)) AS count_skus, s.vendor
FROM
(SELECT DISTINCT(uniq_t_skus.sku) AS sku
FROM 
(SELECT DISTINCT(t.sku) AS sku
FROM trnsact t) AS uniq_t_skus
LEFT OUTER JOIN
(SELECT DISTINCT(s.sku) AS sku
FROM skstinfo s) AS uniq_s_skus
ON uniq_t_skus.sku=uniq_s_skus.sku
WHERE uniq_s_skus.sku IS NULL) AS uniq_t_skus_not_in_s
INNER JOIN skuinfo s
ON uniq_t_skus_not_in_s.sku=s.sku
GROUP BY s.vendor
ORDER BY count_skus DESC;

RIGHT
OUTPUT:5715232

5. What is the brand of the sku with the greatest standard deviation in sprice? 
Only examine skus which have been part of over 100 transactions.

SELECT TOP 5 s.brand, hundred_trnsact_skus.stddev AS stddev
FROM skuinfo s INNER JOIN
(SELECT DISTINCT sku, COUNT(sprice) AS transactions, STDDEV_SAMP(sprice) AS stddev
FROM trnsact
GROUP BY sku
HAVING transactions>100) AS hundred_trnsact_skus
ON s.sku=hundred_trnsact_skus.sku
GROUP BY s.brand, stddev
ORDER BY stddev DESC; 

ALTERNATIVE:

SELECT DISTINCT s.brand, hundred_trnsact_skus.stddev AS stddev
FROM skuinfo s INNER JOIN
(SELECT DISTINCT sku, COUNT(sprice) AS transactions, STDDEV_SAMP(sprice) AS stddev
FROM trnsact
GROUP BY sku
HAVING transactions>91) AS hundred_trnsact_skus
ON s.sku=hundred_trnsact_skus.sku
ORDER BY stddev DESC;

RIGHT
OUTPUT:
CABERNET 178.6
HART SCH 175.9
POLO FAS 170.5
POLO FAS 167.5
POLO FAS 156.6

6. What is the city and state of the store which had the greatest increase in average daily revenue 
(as I define it in Teradata Week 5 Exercise Guide) from November to December?

SELECT st.store, st.city, st.state, 
SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM t.saledate)=11 THEN t.amt END) AS november_revenue,
COUNT(DISTINCT(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM t.saledate)=11 THEN t.saledate END)) AS count_n_dates,
SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM t.saledate)=12 THEN t.amt END) AS december_revenue,
COUNT(DISTINCT(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM t.saledate)=12 THEN t.saledate END)) AS count_d_dates,
november_revenue/count_n_dates AS november_d_revenue,
december_revenue/count_d_dates AS december_d_revenue,
((december_d_revenue-november_d_revenue)/november_d_revenue)*100 AS increase_in_d_revenue
FROM store_msa st INNER JOIN(
SELECT store, saledate, amt
FROM trnsact
WHERE stype='P' AND (EXTRACT(MONTH FROM saledate)=11 OR EXTRACT(MONTH FROM saledate)=12)) AS t
ON st.store=t.store
WHERE st.city IN('McAllen','Tucson','Little Rock','Metairie')
GROUP BY st.store, st.city, st.state
HAVING count_n_dates>20 AND count_d_dates>20
ORDER BY increase_in_d_revenue DESC;

WRONG

7. Compare the average daily revenue (as I define it in Teradata Week 5 Exercise Guide) 
of the store with the highest msa_income and the store with the lowest median msa_income 
(according to the msa_income field). In what city and state were these two stores, 
and which store had a higher average daily revenue?

SELECT
EXTRACT(YEAR FROM t.saledate) AS s_year, 
EXTRACT(MONTH FROM t.saledate) AS s_month, 
COUNT(DISTINCT(t.saledate)) AS count_dates,
SUM(t.amt) AS monthly_revenue,
monthly_revenue/count_dates AS daily_revenue,
store_to_education.education_level AS education,
store_to_education.income AS income,
store_to_education.city AS city,
store_to_education.state AS state
FROM trnsact t JOIN(
SELECT 
store, msa_income AS income, city, state, CASE
WHEN msa_high BETWEEN 50 AND 60 THEN 'low'
WHEN msa_high BETWEEN 60 AND 70 THEN 'medium'
WHEN msa_high>70 THEN 'high'
END AS education_level
FROM store_msa) AS store_to_education ON t.store=store_to_education.store
WHERE t.stype='P' AND NOT(s_year='2005' AND s_month='8') 
AND (income=(SELECT MAX(msa_income) FROM store_msa) OR income=(SELECT MIN(msa_income) FROM store_msa))
HAVING count_dates>=20
GROUP BY s_year, s_month, education, income, city, state
ORDER BY daily_revenue DESC;

RIGHT
OUTPUT: Spanish Fort, AL, lower revenue / McAllen, TX, higher revenue

8. Divide the msa_income groups up so that msa_incomes between 1 and 20,000 are labeled 'low', msa_incomes between 20,001 and 30,000 are labeled 'med-low', msa_incomes between 30,001 and 40,000 are labeled 'med-high', and msa_incomes between 40,001 and 60,000 are labeled 'high'. Which of these groups has the highest average daily revenue (as I define it in Teradata Week 5 Exercise Guide) per store?

SELECT
EXTRACT(YEAR FROM t.saledate) AS s_year, 
EXTRACT(MONTH FROM t.saledate) AS s_month, 
COUNT(DISTINCT(t.saledate)) AS count_dates,
SUM(t.amt) AS monthly_revenue,
monthly_revenue/count_dates AS daily_revenue,
store_to_education.income AS income
FROM trnsact t JOIN(
SELECT 
store, city, state, CASE
WHEN msa_income BETWEEN '1' AND '20000' THEN 'low'
WHEN msa_income BETWEEN '20001' AND '30000' THEN 'med-low'
WHEN msa_income BETWEEN '30001' AND '40000' THEN 'med-high'
WHEN msa_income BETWEEN '40001' AND '60000' THEN 'high'
END AS income
FROM store_msa) AS store_to_education ON t.store=store_to_education.store
WHERE t.stype='P' AND NOT(s_year='2005' AND s_month='8') 
HAVING count_dates>=20
GROUP BY income, s_year, s_month
ORDER BY daily_revenue DESC;

WRONG

9. Divide stores up so that stores with msa populations between 1 and 100,000 are labeled 'very small', stores with msa populations between 100,001 and 200,000 are labeled 'small', stores with msa populations between 200,001 and 500,000 are labeled 'med_small', stores with msa populations between 500,001 and 1,000,000 are labeled 'med_large', stores with msa populations between 1,000,001 and 5,000,000 are labeled “large”, and stores with msa_population greater than 5,000,000 are labeled “very large”. What is the average daily revenue (as I define it in Teradata Week 5 Exercise Guide) for a store in a “very large” population msa?

SELECT AVG(money.daily_revenue)
FROM (
 SELECT t.store AS store,
 SUM(t.amt) AS total_revenue, COUNT(DISTINCT(t.saledate)) AS count_dates, 
 total_revenue/count_dates AS daily_revenue
 FROM trnsact t INNER JOIN (
  SELECT store, CASE
  WHEN msa_pop>5000000 THEN 'very_large'
  ELSE 'not_large'
  END AS big_cities
  FROM store_msa
  WHERE big_cities='very_large') AS big_cities
 ON t.store=big_cities.store
 WHERE t.stype='P'
 AND NOT((EXTRACT(YEAR FROM t.saledate)='2005') AND (EXTRACT(MONTH FROM t.saledate)='8'))
GROUP BY t.store) AS money;

RIGHT

10. Which department in which store had the greatest percent increase in average daily sales revenue from November to December, and what city and state was that store located in? Only examine departments whose total sales were at least $1,000 in both November and December.

SELECT deptinfo.deptdesc, skuinfo.dept, strinfo.store, strinfo.city, strinfo.state, 
SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM t.saledate)=11 THEN t.amt END) AS november_revenue,
COUNT(DISTINCT(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM t.saledate)=11 THEN t.saledate END)) AS count_n_dates,
SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM t.saledate)=12 THEN t.amt END) AS december_revenue,
COUNT(DISTINCT(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM t.saledate)=12 THEN t.saledate END)) AS count_d_dates,
november_revenue/count_n_dates AS november_d_revenue,
december_revenue/count_d_dates AS december_d_revenue,

GROUP BY deptinfo.deptdesc, skuinfo.dept, strinfo.store, strinfo.city, strinfo.state
HAVING count_n_dates>20 AND count_d_dates>20 AND november_revenue>='1000' AND december_revenue>='1000'
ORDER BY increase_in_d_revenue DESC;
